Building librandomcrash:

 - On a debian(-like) system, you'll need automake, autoconf,
   autoconf-archive, libtool packages.
 - Run /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/examples/autogen.sh or autoreconf.
 - Run configure then make.
 - Pray that worked out.

Enjoying it:

 - env LD_PRELOAD=src/.libs/librandomcrash.so.0.0.0 cat /etc/fstab

Options:

You can specify runtime configuration options by setting LRC_CONFIG
environment variable, which should contain colon-separated list of
supported options:
  - no-check -- only do statistics for this run; don't be nasty;
  - logdir=PATH -- location of the log files storage (not yet supported
    by the logging code).
